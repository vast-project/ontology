# About the VAST Ontology
One of the essential goals of the VAST project is to prepare an Ontology of values within their tempo-spatial contexts to simplify further research, dissemination and effective communication of the values by a vast number of stakeholders.
The ontology development is an ongoing process that will run throughout the project and beyond. However, all activities will be built upon the standard foundations described in this document and prepared in a technical form in the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) file format [1] in the document’s Appendix. The model has been built on top of the ISO 21127:2006 / CIDOC CRM [2] version 7.1.1 [3], with some modifications to accommodate specific project needs, mainly:
*	The ability to store conflicting statements within the ontology.
*	The ontology can directly represent crowdsourced knowledge, such as voting for statements.
*	The ability of the ontology to express some additional relationships not envisioned within the original CIDOC CRM.
The ontology design approach in the project comprises the input from both experts and non-experts, which requires some innovative approaches in the ontology building process, particularly the storage of additional metadata about the statements themselves.
Furthermore, to enable the ongoing development of the ontology, common tools have been developed (and will be developed) within the VAST platform, chief among which is the “Ontology Design & Visualisation Tool”, which allows anyone to download the latest copy of the ontology schema in the OWL format, including the current state of the ontology (please see also deliverable D3.3: “VAST online platform v1.0”).
